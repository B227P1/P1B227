Welcome to the prototype of the Sleep Wizard. This prototype was created in order to test, and evaluate
our design, which aims to help university students go to bed earlier. When the program is first ran,
it will guide you through the usage of this prototype with the help of a tutorial. (The tutorial will not be ran on startup after
the first time the "saveData()" function is called. ('s' key)).
